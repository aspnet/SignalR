ASP.NET Core SignalR is a new library for ASP.NET Core developers that makes it incredibly simple to add real-time web functionality to your applications. What is "real-time web" functionality? It's the ability to have your server-side code push content to the connected clients as it happens, in real-time.

You can watch an introductory presentation here - [Introducing ASP.NET Core Sockets](https://vimeo.com/204078084).

This project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.

**Note** To build the project locally at this time you will need the [TypeScript Compiler](https://www.typescriptlang.org/#download-links) on your path.
