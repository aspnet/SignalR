# React App Consumption Test

This app tests consumption of `@aspnet/signalr` from `create-react-app`. When `npm test` is run, the most recent build output from the `signalr` and `signalr-protocol-msgpack` folders is installed and `npm run build` is executed, which verifies that our libraries continue to minify properly.
